## Usage

Once the script is running, the game will prompt you to input words such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and more, which are then inserted into a pre-defined story template to generate a unique and humorous story.

### Steps:

1. Clone the Repository

    ```bash
    python Madlibs Game.py
    ```

2. Follow the prompts to enter various words (e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives).
3. The game will generate and display your personalized Mad Libs story based on your inputs!

## Example

  ```bash
  Enter an adjective: boring

  Enter a noun (person): Dave

  Enter a dessert: pancakes

  Enter an animal: horse

  Enter a noun (place): Winter Wonderland

  Enter a holiday: Christmas

  Enter another adjective: best

  Here is your Mad Libs story:

  One boring morning, I decided to go to the park with Dave.

  The sun was shining, and the air smelled like pancakes.

  As we walked, we saw a horse wearing a black hat, dancing near a Winter Wonderland.

  Surprised, I asked, "Why are you dancing?"

  The horse replied, "Because today is Christmas! Everyone is celebrating!"

  So, I joined the dance, twirling and laughing, and it was the most best day they had ever had.
  ```

  In this example, the user inputs `boring` as a adjective, `Dave` as a noun, and `pancakes` as an dessert. The game then generates a personalized story based on the provided words.
